  **Overview of the Election Audit
  
    The Purpose of the election audit is to utilize our skills with Python to gather and break down data so that it is well organized. The challenege was to gather data and organize and make it display data so that it easier for others to read. We also had to understand how different files work and how to access them depending on the purpose you need it for. After learning how to access the data in different files and then create list, dictionaries, etc. Once we gather the data and organize it, then we can display the information we want to share.
    
**Election Results

  The election results displays the data we want with the code we put into VS code. It shows the Total Votes and then shows how each candidate did using integers.

This pictures shows the data how it represented in my VS code and gives you a ton of data. That shows the election results. The data shows in the picture that there is 369,711 total votes. Majority of the votes came from Denver and the fewest votes came from Arapahoe.Denver had over 80% of the votes and made it the most important county in the election. Looking at the data we can tell that Diana DeGette had the biggest impact in the highest votes in the largest voting county. The cause for her victory where the other two candidates got majority of their votes from the weaker voting district. Diana DeGette won the election and it seems like she was able to capitalize on the biggest voting county, which led to her victory. 

**Election Audit Summary

  We can use some modification to gather data on how each county voted. We can see which counties has the casted the most votes to maybe figure how a candidate can focus their election startegy.Two ways we can use this analysis is that we can have candidates look at how each county voted to develop and campaign startegy. The second way is that we can check to see what counties voted for which candidate to see if there is party biased and we can see if a candidate will lose votes in an area due to the fact that they align with a certain party. That is just two of many different data that we can pull with minor modification to the code.
